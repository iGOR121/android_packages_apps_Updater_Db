# SpiceOS OTA repo
In order for a device to be officially supported by SpiceOS, OTA information needs to be added.
Please refer to the following "Readme" to get started

## 1. Introduction ##
In order for a device to be OTA compliant, there are a few things to know.

### 1.1 JSON structure ###
```

## 2 Guidelines ##
* Check if manufacturer is already existing
* Check if published link is official
* Check if JSON is intact with help of online validator tools like [https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com) or [https://jsonformatter.org](https://jsonformatter.org)
* Check if no extra / missing spaces

## 3. How to ##
For following below description, replace *codename* with your device codename.
### 3.1 Initial support ###
After you contacted [althafvly on Telegram](https://telegram.me/althafvly) or [Anush Madathumkara on Telegram](https://telegram.me/Anush02198), and have the approval, follow the below steps.
1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub
2. Create a copy jasmine_sprout.json for your *codename*.json and fill needed stuff
3. Create a file named changelog_*codename*.txt and add your changelog in it.
4. Submit a pull request to this repo (this way we validate that you understood the requirements and if all is good you'll be granted direct push access to this repo)

### 3.2 Update build ###
1. Clone this repo locally
```
git clone https://github.com/SpiceOS/android_packages_apps_Updater_Db.git -b 11
```
2. Change to the directory where you cloned this repo (android_packages_apps_Updater_Db) and fetch updates from repo.
```
cd android_packages_apps_Updater_Db
git fetch --all
git pull
```
3. Copy *codename*.json file from out dir (where your SpiceOS zip is compiled) over to this repo folder (android_packages_apps_Updater_Db).
4. Make changes to changelog_*codename*.txt and save it.
5. Now with the files updated, commit your update to this repo.
```
git add .
git commit #(this opens up your prefered text editor, so write a nice description like "<device codename>: update build")
git push #you may be prompted for your github username and password
```
